# Film Industry: Original Movie Creation Analysis

## Overview

Our stakeholder is exploring the film industry as a new growth opportunity, aiming to tap into a market with the potential to generate millions of dollars.

To identify the most successful movie genres, we analyzed four different datasets, focusing on domestic gross, profits, average ratings, and number of votes per movie. The results indicate that Action and Adventure genres consistently outperform others across all metrics. Therefore, we recommend focusing on Action and Adventure genres for the new movie business.

## Business Problem

### Entering the Film Industry

Our stakeholder is seeking to diversify their business portfolio by entering the film industry, which presents a lucrative opportunity with the potential to generate substantial revenue. However, with little knowledge about movie production, they face the challenge of determining which types of films are most likely to succeed in the competitive market.

The primary objectives of this analysis are:

1. Identify High-Performing Genres: Determine which movie genres are currently performing best in terms of domestic gross, profits, average ratings, and audience votes.
2. Maximize Financial Success: Provide data-driven recommendations to maximize the financial success of the new movie studio.
3. Strategic Genre Selection: Advise on the optimal genres to focus on for new movie productions.

### Key Questions

To address the business problem, the following key questions were investigated:

1. Which movie genres generate the highest domestic gross and profits?
2. How do average ratings and number of votes vary across different genres?
3. What trends can be identified in the performance of different genres over time?
4. Which genres should the new movie studio prioritize to maximize success?

## Data Understanding

### Overview of Datasets

For this analysis, we utilized four key datasets to gain comprehensive insights into movie performance across different genres:

1. Box Office Mojo:

### Data Exploration

Initial data exploration involved understanding the structure, types, and distribution of data in each dataset. Key steps included:

1. Data Cleaning:

   - Removing duplicates, irrelevant, and "Unknown" entries.
   - Filtering the data to be from 2010
   - Handling missing values by either imputing or removing them based on their significance.

2. Data Standardization:

   - Standardizing column names and formats to ensure consistency across datasets.
   - Converting release dates to a uniform format and currency objects to int formats.

3. Descriptive Statistics:

   - Calculating summary statistics (mean, median, mode) for key numerical columns.
   - Analyzing the distribution of ratings, gross earnings, and budget values.

4. Feature Engineering:
   - Created new columns such as: profit/loss, average rating, total number of votes
   - Created new dataframes: genre ratings, sequel movies, genres by profit/roi/popularity, directors/producers, studio profit/gross, and successful directors/producers by ratings
   - Combined all four of the datasets together based on movie title

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

After merging all four datasets based on movie titles, we ensured that each combined record had complete data for all columns, eliminating any missing values. This step was crucial for integrating the datasets seamlessly.

With the datasets merged, we filtered the data to focus on the specific concerns of our stakeholder. Our initial analysis examined the general trends in movie release years and their corresponding domestic gross earnings.

![genre trend](/images/Genre%20Trend%20Over%20the%20Years.jpg)

We found that Action is by far the most successful type of genre. It towers over the other genres significantly from 2010 to 2018.

Next we then compared the average ratings of all genres to see what the distribution of the average ratings and genres.

![rating by genre](/images/average_rating_by_genre.jpg)

After reviewing the distribution of average rating by genre we can see that Action and Adventure weren't the highest, but instead Documentary and Music were ranked the best.

But why?

Because of this we graphed top genres by profit and by popularity to determine the combinations of each movie and check which are the most profitable and the most popular.

![genres by profit](/images/top_genres_by_profit.jpg)

![genres by popularity](/images/top_genres_by_popularity.jpg)

After reviewing both of these graphs, we concluded that even though documentary and music were the highest rated, they weren't the most popular. They were skewed by the limited number of votes they had leading them to be the "highest" ranked genres.

But considering this, action and adventure remained in the majority of the top genres by profit and popularity further supporting our evidence.

Once we determined the best performing genres, the next question we took into account was: who could help us?

To find this out we took the top 10 studios by profit and ranked them from greatest in profit to least in profit. This wasn't enough information so we also included top 10 studios that made adventure and action movies in profit.

![studios by profit](/images/Top%2010%20Studios%20by%20Profit.jpg)

![number of action movies by studio](/images/Number%20of%20Action%20Movies%20by%20Studio.jpg)

![action studios by profit](/images/Top%2010%20Action%20Studios%20by%20Profit.jpg)

![number of adventure movies by studio](/images/Number%20of%20Adventure%20Movies%20by%20Studio.jpg)

![adventure studios by profit](/images/Top%2010%20Adventure%20Studios%20by%20Profit.jpg)

BV is the clear winner in this context. BV ranks number 1 in all studios by profit, adventure studio by profit, and action studios by profit. The error margins mean that BV has the chance to fall anywhere in between the error lines. But even considering this BV is the obvious winner.

Next was to help our stakeholder determine when to start. To do this we plotted total gross of movies per month, which shows how much all movies made in every month.

![gross by month](/images/Gross%20by%20Month.jpg)

Examining the graph we can see that movies perform the best in the months of November and December.

We have the studio and the time, what do we need next... the Director!

The Director is the most important part of our casting, and our only casting. The director is in charge of hiring and casting everyone required for a film. To find the best director for our target genres we found the top rated directors based on action and adventure genres.

![director/producer with highest profit](/images/Director%20with%20the%20Highest%20Profit.jpg)

![director/producer with the highest rating](/images/average_rating_by_primary_name.jpg)

After determining the top 3 directors - Gareth Edwards, Jake Kasdan, and Ryan Coogler, for this role we have decided to choose Ryan Coogler to be our head director.

Ryan Coogler has the highest rating with the most number of other movies produced, therefore the highest overall ranking of the 3. Ryan Coogler also has produced movies with BV before, futhermore he has also created very successful action movies such as: Black Panther and Creed.

## Conclusions and Recommendations:

1. **Best Genres for Production:**

   - Primary: Action (highest grossing and profitable)
   - Secondary: Adventure (second in gross and profits)
   - Tertiary: Comedy or Drama (based on director/producer comfort)

2. **Optimal Release Time:**

   - Best months for movie success: November and December

3. **Recommended Partnerships:**
